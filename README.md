# DataSet
Question Categories and Patterns : "Modality, Plane, Organ System, and Abnormality"

--The Modality category includes Yes/No, WH, and closed questions, while 

--the Plane and Organ System categories consist of WH questions. 

--The Abnormality category includes Yes/No and WH questions

-- Additionally, the passage lists the 16 plane types, 10 organ systems, and 36 mod

# limitations:
There are a few limitations to consider when using this model.
it was trained as a classification problem with only 1552 limited answers, rather than a generative one.
This means that the model may not be able to provide diverse answers to complex  questions.
